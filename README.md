# Protein_Toolkit_For_Houdini-
The Protein Visualization Toolkit for Houdini!
The plan is to keep this toolkit open source so Houdini can be used more in protein renders. 
Currently building the toolkit in Houdini LC until I am happy with the toolkit. Instead, get all the kinks worked out and then 
make a commercial version, then waste money and time. 

So far this tool is in its V.3 Build 

So far, this toolkit can build your standard ball and stick/wireframe models, space-filling diagrams, and ribbon models. As well as:

-Rough animation techniques through noise.
-Creation of wireframe models
-Isolation of Carbon/Oxygen/Nitrogen elements
-Creation of Space Filling Diagrams
-Creation of Ribbon Diagrams
-Correct count of Atoms, Elements per Amino acid, and Chains.
-Better Wireframe, Space filling, and Ribbon creation
-Better isolation and visualization of Amino acids.
-Animation using temperature factor HDAs
-Chain isolation HDAs
-Functions for working with open and closed virus proteins.  
- HDAs for visualizing sequences, Ribonucleotides, and Deoxyribonucleotides
- Application of atomic properties

Let me know if you have any suggestions!
